\section*{Acknowledgement}
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our instructor, \textbf{Dr. Van-Giang Trinh}, for his dedicated guidance and for providing the fundamental knowledge 
of Mathematical Modeling that made this project possible. His lectures and course materials were instrumental in helping us understand the complex concepts of Petri nets and Boolean algebra.

We also wish to thank the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) for providing an excellent academic environment that encourages research 
and practical application. And lastly, we appreciate the constructive feedback and support from our peers during the development of this project.
